## Constellations and Star Patterns

### What are Constellations?
Constellations are groups of stars that form recognizable patterns in the night sky. These patterns have been observed and named by different cultures throughout history. While the stars in a constellation may appear close together, they are often vastly distant from each other.

### Mythology and Constellations
Many cultures have rich mythologies associated with constellations. Greek and Roman mythology is particularly well-known for its constellation stories. For example, the constellation Orion is often linked to the Greek hunter of the same name.

### Stargazing Tips
To observe constellations, it's best to find a dark location away from city lights. A star map or astronomy app can be helpful in identifying constellations. Using binoculars or a telescope can enhance the viewing experience.

### Asterisms
Asterisms are smaller, recognizable patterns within constellations. The Big Dipper is a famous example of an asterism within the Ursa Major constellation.
